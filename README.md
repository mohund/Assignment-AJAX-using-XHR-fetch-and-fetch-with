# Weather Now!

This project is a simple weather application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the Weather API. The app allows users to enter a city name and display key weather information such as temperature, wind, humidity, and more.

## Files in this repository

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage. It includes a search bar where users can input the city name and a container to display the weather information.
- **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles for the webpage. It defines the layout, font styles, button designs, and the overall appearance of the weather app.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file responsible for fetching the weather data from the Weather API. It processes the user input (city name) and updates the displayed weather data dynamically.
